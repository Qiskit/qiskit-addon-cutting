deprecations:
  - |
    The :func:`.execute_experiments` function has been deprecated.
    Going forward, users should first call
    :func:`.generate_cutting_experiments` to generate the
    subexperiment circuits and then submit these circuits directly to
    the desired Sampler(s).  The `tutorials <https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-cutting/tutorials/index.html>`__ have been updated with this new workflow.
