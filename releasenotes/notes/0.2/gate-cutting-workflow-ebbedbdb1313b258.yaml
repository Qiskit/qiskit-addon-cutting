    0.2.0 is centered around the addition of functions which allow for the easy
    implementation of a circuit cutting technique called gate cutting. For more details on circuit cutting, check out our
    `explanation guide <https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-cutting/explanation/index.html>`__.

    The foundation of the :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting` package is the :mod:`circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd`
    sub-package. The :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd` package allows for easy transformation of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` gates and wires into elements which may be decomposed to a probabilistic set of basis gates.
    See :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis` and :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.BaseQPDGate` classes for more information.

    Additionally, 0.2.0 includes a set of functions which allow for easy implementation of gate cutting workflows.
    These functions are built on top of the :mod:`circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd` package. Like all
    circuit knitting techniques, gate cutting can be described as three consecutive stages: *decomposition* of a problem,
    *execution* of many subexperiments, and *reconstruction* of a simulated output of the original problem.
    These steps may be implemented with the :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting` package using only a few primary
    functions, namely, the :func:`.partition_problem`, :func:`.decompose_gates`, :func:`.execute_experiments`, and :func:`.reconstruct_expectation_values` functions.
    Check out the `tutorials <https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-cutting/tutorials/index.html>`__ for a look at a couple of example circuit cutting workflows.

features:
  - |
    Addition of a :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd` package which allows for easy
    transformation of :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` gates and wires into elements which may be decomposed to a
    probabilistic set of basis gates. See :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis` and :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.BaseQPDGate` classes for more information.
  - |
    Addition of :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutting_decomposition`, :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutting_execution`,
    and :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutting_reconstruction` modules. These modules
    provide several functions which allow for easy implementation of gate cutting workflows, namely,
    the :func:`.partition_problem`, :func:`.decompose_gates`, :func:`.execute_experiments`, and :func:`.reconstruct_expectation_values` functions.

issues:
  - |
    The :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting` package only supports :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliList` observables for calculating expectation values. Support for calculating
    expectation values for more observable types, including :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp`, is expected no sooner than 0.3.0.
  - |
    The ``Sampler``\ s from Qiskit and Qiskit Aer do not support mid-circuit measurements in statevector mode. For more on generating exact quasi-distributions using the :class:`~qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler` interface, check out our `how-to guide <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/blob/stable/0.7/docs/circuit_cutting/how-tos/how_to_generate_exact_quasi_dists_from_sampler.ipynb>`_.

    The :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting` package generally does not yet support input circuits with user-added
    classical bits, so by extension, it does not yet support dynamic circuits.
