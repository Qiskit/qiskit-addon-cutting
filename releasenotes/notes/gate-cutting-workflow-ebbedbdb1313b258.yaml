    0.2.0 is centered around the addition of functions which allow for the easy
    implementation of gate cutting workflows.

    The foundation of the CKT circuit cutting API is the :mod:`circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd`
    package. This module allows for easy transformation of elements of quantum circuits (gates and wires) into
    elements which probabilistically decompose to a particular set of gates with respect to a given probabilistic basis.
    See :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis` and
    :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.BaseQPDGate` for more information.

    Additionally, 0.2.0 includes a set of functions which allow for easy implementation
    of gate cutting workflows. These functions are built on top of the QPD package. Like all circuit
    knitting techniques, gate cutting can be described as three consecutive stages: decomposition of a problem,
    execution of many subexperiments, and reconstruction of a simulated output of the original problem.
    These steps may be implemented with the :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting` module using only a few primary
    functions, namely, the `partition_problem`, `decompose_gates`, `execute_experiments`, and `reconstruct_expectation_values` functions.
    Check out the `tutorials <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/tree/main/docs/circuit_cutting/tutorials>`_ for a look at a couple of example circuit cutting workflows.

    Addition of :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd` package which allows for easy
    transformation of elements of quantum circuits (gates and wires) into elements which
    probabilistically decompose to a particular set of gates with respect to a given probabilistic basis. See 
    :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis` and 
    :class:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd.BaseQPDGate` for more information.

    Addition of :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutting_decomposition`, :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutting_decomposition`,
    and :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutting_decomposition` modules. These modules
    provide several functions which allow for easy implementation of a gate cutting workflow, namely,
    the `partition_problem`, `decompose_gates`, `execute_experiments`, and `reconstruct_expectation_value` functions.
issues:
  - |
    The :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting` package only supports ``PauliList`` observables for calculating expectation values. Support for calculating
    expectation values for more observable types, including :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp`, is expected no sooner than 0.3.0.

    The Qiskit and Qiskit Aer samplers do not support mid-circuit measurements in statevector mode. For more on reconstructing exact
    expectation values in a circuit cutting workflow, check out our `how-to guide <https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/tree/main/docs/circuit_cutting/how-tos/how_to_generate_exact_quasi_dists_from_sampler.ipynb>`_.

    The :mod:`~circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting` package generally does not yet support input circuits with user-added
    classical bits, so by extension, it does not yet support dynamic circuits.
