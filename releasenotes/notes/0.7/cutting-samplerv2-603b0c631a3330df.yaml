    Circuit cutting reconstruction can now interpret the
    :class:`~qiskit.primitives.PrimitiveResult` object, which is
    returned by version 2 of the sampler primitive
    (:class:`~qiskit.primitives.BaseSamplerV2`).  See the `migration guide
    <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/migration-guides/qiskit-1.0-features#qiskitprimitives>`__
    for details on upgrading to version 2 of the Qiskit primitives.
