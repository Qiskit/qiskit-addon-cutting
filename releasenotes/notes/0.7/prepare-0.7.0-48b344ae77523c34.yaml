prelude:

  The 0.7 release introduces an automated cut finding code for the new
  circuit cutting workflow.  With this milestone, the older cutting
  workflow (CutQC) is now deprecated.  Additionally, this is the first
  CKT release to support version 2 of the Qiskit Runtime primitives.
  User are encouraged to `migrate to v2 primitives
  <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/migration-guides/v2-primitives>`__
  as soon as possible.

    The cutting tutorials have been rephrased with the goal of
    reconstructing the expectation value of a single
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp` with many terms,
    rather than multiple independent
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli` observables.

    The `circuit cutting explanation
    <https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-cutting/explanation/index.html>`__ document has been
    expanded significantly.
