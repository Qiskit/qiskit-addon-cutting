deprecations:
  - |
    The ``circuit_knitting.cutting.cutqc`` package is deprecated and will be removed no sooner than Circuit Knitting Toolbox 0.8.0. 
    The wire cutting functionality in the :mod:`circuit_knitting.cutting` package is what will be maintained going forward. 
    Additionally, there is a new automated gate and wire cut-finding functionality in the :mod:`circuit_knitting.cutting.automated_cut_finding` module.
    A `tutorial <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/blob/stable/0.7/docs/circuit_cutting/tutorials/04_automatic_cut_finding.ipynb>`__ has been added to demonstrate automated cut-finding.
