    r"""
    Reconstruct an expectation value from the results of the sub-experiments.

    Args:
        results: The results from running the cutting subexperiments. If the cut circuit
            was not partitioned between qubits and run separately, this argument should be
            a :class:`~qiskit.primitives.SamplerResult` instance or a dictionary mapping
            a single partition to the results. If the circuit was partitioned and its
            pieces were run separately, this argument should be a dictionary mapping partition labels
            to the results from each partition's subexperiments.

            The subexperiment results are expected to be ordered in the same way the subexperiments
            are ordered in the output of :func:`.generate_cutting_experiments` -- one result for every
            sample and observable, as shown below. The Qiskit Sampler primitive will return the results
            in the same order the experiments are submitted, so users who do not use :func:`.generate_cutting_experiments`
            to generate their experiments should take care to order their subexperiments as follows before submitting them
            to the sampler primitive:

            :math:`[sample_{0}observable_{0}, \ldots, sample_{0}observable_{N-1}, sample_{1}observable_{0}, \ldots, sample_{M-1}observable_{N-1}]`

        coefficients: A sequence containing the coefficient associated with each unique subexperiment. Each element is a tuple
            containing the coefficient (a ``float``) together with its :class:`.WeightType`, which denotes
            how the value was generated. The contribution from each subexperiment will be multiplied by
            its corresponding coefficient, and the resulting terms will be summed to obtain the reconstructed expectation value.
        observables: The observable(s) for which the expectation values will be calculated.
            This should be a :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.PauliList` if ``results`` is a
            :class:`~qiskit.primitives.SamplerResult` instance. Otherwise, it should be a
            dictionary mapping partition labels to the observables associated with that partition.

    Returns:
        A ``list`` of ``float``\ s, such that each float is an expectation
        value corresponding to the input observable in the same position

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``observables`` and ``results`` are of incompatible types.
        ValueError: An input observable has a phase not equal to 1.
