class SearchFunctions:

    """Data class for holding functions needed to generate and explore
    a search space.  In addition to the required input arguments, the function
    signatures are assumed to also allow additional input arguments that are
    needed to perform the corresponding computations.

    Member Variables:

    cost_func (lambda state, *args) is a function that computes cost values
    from search states.  The cost returned can be numeric or tuples of
    numerics.  In the latter case, lexicographical comparisons are performed
    per Python semantics.

    next_state_func (lambda state, *args) is a function that returns a list
    of next states generated from the input state.  An ActionNames object
    should be incorporated into the additional input arguments in order to
    generate next-states.

    goal_state_func (lambda state, *args) is a function that returns True if
    the input state is a solution state of the search.

    upperbound_cost_func (lambda goal_state, *args) can either be None or a
    function that returns an upper bound to the optimal cost given a goal_state
    as input.  The upper bound is used to prune next-states from the search in
    subsequent calls to the optimizationPass() method of the search algorithm.
    If upperbound_cost_func is None, the cost of the goal_state as determined
    by cost_func is used as an upper bound to the optimal cost.  If the
    upperbound_cost_func returns None, the effect is equivalent to returning
    an infinite upper bound (i.e., no cost pruning is performed on subsequent
    optimization calls.

    mincost_bound_func (lambda *args) can either be None or a function that
    returns a cost bound that is compared to the minimum cost across all
    vertices in a search frontier.  If the minimum cost exceeds the min-cost
    bound, the search is terminated even if a goal state has not yet been found.
    Returning None is equivalent to returning an infinite min-cost bound (i.e.,
    min-cost checking is effectively not performed).  A mincost_bound_func that
    is None is likewise equivalent to an infinite min-cost bound.
