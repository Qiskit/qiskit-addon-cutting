Installation Instructions
=========================

Let's see how to install the Qiskit addon for circuit cutting. The first
thing to do is choose how you're going to run and install the
packages. There are three primary ways to do this:

- :ref:`Option 1`
- :ref:`Option 2`
- :ref:`Option 3`

Users who wish to run within a containerized environment may skip the
pre-installation and move straight to :ref:`Option 3`.

Pre-Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users who wish to install locally (using either :ref:`Option 1` or :ref:`Option 2`) are encouraged to
follow a brief set of common instructions to prepare a Python environment for
installation:

First, create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it. We recommend using `Python virtual environments <https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html>`__.

.. code:: sh
    
    python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment

Activate your new environment.

.. code:: sh
    
    source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate

Note: If you are using Windows, use the following commands in PowerShell:

.. code:: pwsh
    
    python3 -m venv c:\path\to\virtual\environment
    c:\path\to\virtual\environment\Scripts\Activate.ps1


.. _Option 1:

Option 1: Install from PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most straightforward way to install the ``qiskit-addon-cutting`` package is via PyPI.

.. code:: sh

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install qiskit-addon-cutting


.. _Option 2:

Option 2: Install from Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users who wish to develop in the repository or run the notebooks locally may want to install from source.

In either case, the first step is to clone the ``qiskit-addon-cutting`` repository.

.. code:: sh

    git clone git@github.com:Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting.git
    
Next, upgrade pip and enter the repository. 

.. code:: sh
    
    pip install --upgrade pip
    cd qiskit-addon-cutting

The next step is to install to the virtual environment. If you plan on running the notebooks, install the
notebook dependencies in order to run all the visualizations in the notebooks.
If you plan on developing in the repository, you may want to install the ``dev`` dependencies.

Adjust the options below to suit your needs.

.. code:: sh
    
    pip install tox notebook -e '.[notebook-dependencies,dev]'

If you installed the notebook dependencies, you can get started with the addon by running the notebooks in the docs.

.. code::
    
    cd docs/
    jupyter notebook


.. _Option 3:

Option 3: Use within Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have provided a `Dockerfile <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/blob/main/Dockerfile>`__, which can be used to
build a Docker image, as well as a
`compose.yaml <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/blob/main/compose.yaml>`__ file, which allows one
to use the Docker image with just a few simple commands.

.. code:: sh

    git clone git@github.com:Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting.git
    cd qiskit-addon-cutting
    docker compose build
    docker compose up

Depending on your system configuration, you may need to type ``sudo``
before each ``docker compose`` command.

.. note::

   If you are instead using `podman <https://podman.io/>`_ and
   `podman-compose <https://github.com/containers/podman-compose>`_,
   the commands are:

   .. code:: sh

       podman machine start
       podman-compose --podman-pull-args short-name-mode="permissive" build
       podman-compose up

Once the container is running, you should see a message like this:

::

    notebook_1  |     To access the server, open this file in a browser:
    notebook_1  |         file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-7-open.html
    notebook_1  |     Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    notebook_1  |         http://e4a04564eb39:8888/lab?token=00ed70b5342f79f0a970ee9821c271eeffaf760a7dcd36ec
    notebook_1  |      or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=00ed70b5342f79f0a970ee9821c271eeffaf760a7dcd36ec

Locate the *last* URL in your terminal (the one that includes
``127.0.0.1``), and navigate to that URL in a web browser to access the
Jupyter Notebook interface.

The home directory includes a subdirectory named ``persistent-volume``.
All work youâ€™d like to save should be placed in this directory, as it is
the only one that will be saved across different container runs.


.. _Platform Support:

Platform Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We expect this package to work on `any platform supported by Qiskit <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install#operating-system-support>`__. If
you are experiencing issues running the software on your device, you
may consider :ref:`using this package within Docker <Option 3>`.
