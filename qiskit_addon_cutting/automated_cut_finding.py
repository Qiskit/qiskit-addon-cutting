    """Find cut locations in a circuit, given optimization parameters and cutting constraints.

    Args:
        circuit: The circuit to cut. The input circuit may not contain gates acting
            on more than two qubits.
        optimization: Options for controlling optimizer behavior. Currently, the optimal
            cuts are chosen using Dijkstra's best-first search algorithm.
        constraints: Constraints on how the circuit may be partitioned
    Returns:
        A circuit containing :class:`.BaseQPDGate` instances. The subcircuits
        resulting from cutting these gates will be runnable on the devices meeting
        the ``constraints``.

        A metadata dictionary:
            - cuts: A list of length-2 tuples describing each cut in the output circuit.
              The tuples are formatted as ``(cut_type: str, cut_id: int)``. The
              cut ID is the index of the cut gate or wire in the output circuit's
              ``data`` field.
            - sampling_overhead: The sampling overhead incurred from cutting the specified
              gates and wires.
            - minimum_reached: A bool indicating whether or not the search conclusively found
              the minimum of cost function. ``minimum_reached = False`` could also mean that the
              cost returned was actually the lowest possible cost but that the search was
              not allowed to run long enough to prove that this was the case.

    Raises:
        ValueError: The input circuit contains a gate acting on more than 2 qubits.
