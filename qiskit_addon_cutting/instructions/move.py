            ┌───────┐
       q_0: ┤0      ├       q_0: ──────X─

    The desired effect of this instruction, typically, is to move the state of
    the first qubit to the second qubit.  For this to work as expected, the
    second incoming qubit must share no entanglement with the remainder of the
    system.  If this qubit *is* entangled, then performing the reset operation
    will in turn implement a quantum channel on the other qubit(s) with which
    it is entangled, resulting in the partial collapse of those qubits.

    The simplest way to ensure that the second (i.e., destination) qubit shares
    no entanglement with the remainder of the system is to use a fresh qubit
    which has not been used since initialization.

    Another valid way is to use, as a desination qubit, a qubit whose immediate
    prior use was as the source (i.e., first) qubit of a preceding
    :class:`Move` operation.

    The following circuit contains two :class:`Move` operations, corresponding
    to each of the aforementioned cases:

       :include-source:

       import numpy as np
       from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
       from qiskit_addon_cutting.instructions import Move

       qc = QuantumCircuit(4)
       qc.ryy(np.pi / 4, 0, 1)
       qc.rx(np.pi / 4, 3)
       qc.append(Move(), [1, 2])
       qc.rz(np.pi / 4, 0)
       qc.ryy(np.pi / 4, 2, 3)
       qc.append(Move(), [2, 1])
       qc.ryy(np.pi / 4, 0, 1)
       qc.rx(np.pi / 4, 3)
       qc.draw("mpl")

    A full demonstration of the :class:`Move` instruction is available in `the
    introductory tutorial on wire cutting
