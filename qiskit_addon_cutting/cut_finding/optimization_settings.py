    """Specify the parameters that control the optimization.

    ``max_gamma`` specifies a constraint on the maximum value of gamma that a
    solution is allowed to have to be considered feasible. If a solution exists
    but the associated gamma exceeds ``max_gamma``, :func:`.greedy_best_first_search`,
    which is used to warm start the search engine will still return a valid albeit
    typically suboptimal solution.

    ``engine_selections`` is a dictionary that defines the selection
    of search engines for the optimization.

    ``max_backjumps`` specifies any constraints on the maximum number of backjump
    operations that can be performed by the search algorithm.

    ``seed`` is a seed used to provide a repeatable initialization
    of the pesudorandom number generators used by the optimization.
    If None is used as the random seed, then a seed is obtained using an
    operating-system call to achieve an unrepeatable randomized initialization.

    NOTE: The current release only supports LO gate and wire cuts. LOCC
    flags have been incorporated with an eye towards future releases.
