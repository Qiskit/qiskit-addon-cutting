    If ``partition_labels`` is provided, then qubits with matching partition
    labels will be grouped together, and non-local gates spanning more than one
    partition will be cut apart.  The label ``None`` is treated specially: any
    qubit with that partition label must be unused in the circuit.

    If ``partition_labels`` is not provided, then it will be determined
    automatically from the connectivity of the circuit.  This automatic
    determination ignores any :class:`.TwoQubitQPDGate`\ s in the ``circuit``,
    as these denote instructions that are explicitly destined for cutting.  The
    resulting partition labels, in the automatic case, will be consecutive
    integers starting with 0.  Qubits which are idle throughout the circuit
    will be assigned a partition label of ``None``.

    All cut instructions will be replaced with :class:`.SingleQubitQPDGate`\ s.

    If provided, ``observables`` will be separated along the boundaries specified by
    the partition labels.
