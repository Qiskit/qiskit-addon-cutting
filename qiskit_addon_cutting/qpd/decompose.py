    r"""Replace all QPD instructions in the circuit with local Qiskit operations and measurements.

    Args:
        circuit: The circuit containing QPD instructions
        instruction_ids: A 2D sequence, such that each inner sequence corresponds to indices
            of instructions comprising one decomposition in the circuit. The elements within a
            common sequence belong to a common decomposition and should be sampled together.
        map_ids: Indices to a specific linear mapping to be applied to the decompositions
            in the circuit. If no map IDs are provided, the circuit will be decomposed randomly
            according to the decompositions' joint probability distribution.
        inplace: If ``True``, the ``circuit`` will be modified in place.

    Returns:
        Circuit which has had all its :class:`BaseQPDGate` instances decomposed into local operations.

        The circuit will contain a new, final classical register to contain the QPD measurement
        outcomes (accessible at ``retval.cregs[-1]``).

    Raises:
        ValueError: An index in ``instruction_ids`` corresponds to a gate which is not a
            :class:`BaseQPDGate` instance.
        ValueError: A list within instruction_ids is not length 1 or 2.
        ValueError: The total number of indices in ``instruction_ids`` does not equal the number
            of :class:`BaseQPDGate` instances in the circuit.
        ValueError: Gates within the same decomposition hold different QPD bases.
        ValueError: Length of ``map_ids`` does not equal the number of decompositions in the circuit.
