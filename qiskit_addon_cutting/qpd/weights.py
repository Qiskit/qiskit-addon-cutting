    r"""Determine all exact weights above ``threshold`` and the conditional probabilities necessary to sample efficiently from all other weights.

    Each yielded element will be a 2-tuple, the first element of which will be
    a ``state``, represented by a tuple of ``int``\ s.

    If ``state`` contains the same number of elements as
    ``coeff_probabilities``, then the second element will be a ``float``,
    greater than or equal to ``threshold``, that contains the exact probability
    of this ``state``.

    If, on the other hand, ``state`` contains fewer elements than
    ``coeff_probabilities``, then the second element is a 1D ``np.ndarray`` of
    the conditional probabilities that can be used to sample the remaining
    weights that have not been evaluated exactly (i.e., are below
    ``threshold``).  These will all be normalized *except* the
    top-level one, which is given by ``state == ()``.

    If there are no exact weights below a given level, then the conditional
    probabilities at that level are equivalent to the corresponding element of
    `coeff_probabilities``, and this generator does not yield them.  Skipping
    redundant conditional probabilities, like this, allows for efficient
    sampling without traversing the entire tree, which is desirable since the
    tree grows exponentially with the number of cut gates.  By contrast, the
    performance with the provided strategy is no worse than linear in
    ``threshold``, in both time and memory.

    This function assumes each element of ``coeff_probabilities`` contains
    non-negative numbers, ordered largest to smallest.  For a generalization
    that allows ``coeff_probabilities`` to be provided in any order, see
    :func:`_generate_exact_weights_and_conditional_probabilities`.
